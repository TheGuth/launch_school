## Introduction

## Getting Started

If you're like most people, you've been using the internet for a long time - years, perhaps decades - and typing in those pesky URL addresses at the top of your browser, starting with the letters H, T, T, P, followed by the colon, slash, slash, w, w, w then the domain, over and over and over, yet never knowing or caring to know about what it stood for.

HTTP is at the core of what the web is about, and also at the core of dynamic web applications. Understanding HTTP is central to understanding how modern web applications work and how they're built. This book will cover some basic concepts around HTTP, and you'll have a much better understanding of how the web and web applications work after going through it.

## Who Is This Guide For?

This book is geared towards those who have been using the internet for a while, but have never built dynamic web applications before. It's meant for people interested in understanding how web applications work, and lays the foundational knowledge to learning more advanced web application development concepts.

## How To Read This Guide?

Most of this book is going to be reading oriented. That is, there are not a lot of exercises, because this is mostly a book about concepts. However, where there are examples, please take time to follow along and learn by doing. There is no better way to truly understand a topic than by doing.

# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. 
# The return value should a string that begins with the century number, 
# and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 
# comprise the 20th century.

# Examples:

# century(2000) == '20th'
# century(2001) == '21st'
# century(1965) == '20th'
# century(256) == '3rd'
# century(5) == '1st'
# century(10103) == '102nd'

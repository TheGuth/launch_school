start of the program

define a method called sum, which takes two numbers as arguments passed to the sum method.
the method then sets result = to the addition of number 1 with number 2.

prints result

end of the program

start of the program

define a method called one_string
the method will take in one argument that is an array of strings
we will iterate over each item in the array and add it to our
new variable called final_string which will be set to a blank string. 
each time we iterate final_string should have 
a ' ' + item.to_s added to it

print finalt_string once we have iterated through each item in the array

end of the program

start of the program

define a method called every_other_one
takes an array of numbers as an argument
we initialize a new_array set as [] an empty array. we then 
iterate over each item in the array passed as our argument. 
if item being iterated over % by 2 = 0 then we add that item
  to our new_array
else we moveo on to the next item

  print the results of our New_array.
